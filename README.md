# discord-crypto-simulator
This project is a discord bot that allows users to simulate the world of cryptocurrency in a smaller scale.
The bot simulates trading and mining crypto.
It allows users to trade crypto for virtual money, tracks the crypto's live price and records all transactions with specific transaction IDs that can be viewed by the user.
The bot also allows the users to buy hardwares and mining softwares to mine the crypto.
There are numerous stages of hardware and software, each one increasing either speed, accuracy or convenience.
